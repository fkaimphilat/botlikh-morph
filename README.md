# Botlikh morphology

## Background

[Botlikh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botlikh_language) is a minority language that belongs to the Andic branch of the Nakh-Dagestanian language family.

This repository contains a prototype for a Botlikh morphological analyzer. Currently it processes only nouns and numerals. See the [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1woS1dzNJDn-pb3D75tW5CIw6KdB_jMns/view?usp=sharing) for a detailed description.

It is a part of a larger project by the students of the [School of Linguistics](https://ling.hse.ru/en/) at the NRU HSE that aims to provide digital tools for endangered languages.

Morphological parsers of other North Caucasian languages, made by other HSE students, can be found here:
