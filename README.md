# Botlikh morphology

## Background

[Botlikh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botlikh_language) is a minority language that belongs to the Andic branch of the Nakh-Dagestanian language family.

This repository contains a prototype for a Botlikh morphological analyzer. Currently it processes only nouns and numerals. See the [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1woS1dzNJDn-pb3D75tW5CIw6KdB_jMns/view?usp=sharing) for a detailed description.

It is a part of a larger project by the students of the [School of Linguistics](https://ling.hse.ru/en/) at the NRU HSE that aims to provide digital tools for endangered languages.

Morphological parsers of other North Caucasian languages, made by other HSE students, can be found here:

- [Agul (Lezgic)](https://github.com/nstsi/agul)
- [Andi (Andic)](https://github.com/vbunt/andi)
- [Bagvalal (Andic)](https://github.com/ruthenian8/bagvalal)
- [Chamalal (Andic)](https://github.com/ZinaBudilova/Chamalal_parser)
- [Rutul (Lezgic)](https://github.com/Hanna-Cupery/rutul)

## Sources

The current work is based on the linguistic description of Botlikh by Azaev (2000), Magomedbekova (1998), and Alexeyev & Verhees (2021, draft) as well as [the corpus of Andic languages collected and annotated by Moroz et al.](https://github.com/phon-dicts-project/comparative_andic_dictionary_database)
